# Portainer Data Directory

The `data` directory serves as the `/data` directory for the Portainer container. It will automatically be used for Portainer's configuration and persistent data storage as specified by the Docker Compose configuration.

## Setup and Configuration

No additional setup is required for the `data` directory. It will be utilized by the Portainer container according to the configuration specified in the Docker Compose file.

Ensure that the necessary configurations, including any required environment variables or settings, are correctly applied to the `data` directory as per the Docker Compose configuration.
